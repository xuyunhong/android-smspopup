# Introduction #
We finally found an easier way to translate Android application strings and have set this up for SMS Popup.  We have miracle2k's [android2po](http://github.com/miracle2k/android2po) to thank!

This page contains a short howto and FAQs for using this new translation mechanism.  Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.

# Howto: Contributing translated strings to SMS Popup #
  1. Register on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/).
  1. Go to [smspopup translations](https://translations.launchpad.net/smspopup)
  1. Choose you language and start translating!

# FAQs #

## I want to translate it to language X but it's not listed on Launchpad ##
Go to your user preference and add language X.
_language preference is at https://launchpad.net/~youruser/+editlanguages__

After adding it, it will appear on the list.

## When will the new translations show in SMS Popup? ##
We don't have a strict release schedule right now, however in the past there has been one new public SMS Popup release every 4-6 weeks.  Each time we do a release to Android Market we will sync the translated strings from Launchpad to SVN.

## I found an incorrect translation, should I fix it? ##
Of course! You can re-translate any of the current strings if you spot an error.
